<h1>The Ballycateen Sofa</h1>
<p>Shown here in a dyed Irish linen, single feather and down seat cushion and exposed show wood in stained oak.</p>
<p>The sofa design from the Georgian Regency period.</p>
<p>Both the frame making and upholstery are carried out within a 20 kilometre radius of our base in Kinsdale Co. Cork. We use traditional methods and materials, which are carefully and sympathetically balanced with modern techniques and equipment. This allows us to keep the build of each sofa as true to the original as possible.</p>
<p>Features such as tenon joints and the smooth, hand shaped frame are characteristics we’ve been keen to carry forward from some of the most respected and well known sofa and chair makers of the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<h2>The Upholstery</h2>
<p>The Ballycatteen is upholstered in Kinsale using a careful blend of traditional methods and materials, as well as modern techniques and equipment where appropriate.

<h1>The DeCourcey Armchair</h1>
<p>Shown here upholstered in a heavy gauge linen with tapered oak front legs and brass castors.</p>
<p>Both the frame making and upholstery are carried out within a 20 kilometre radius of our base in Kinsale, Co. Cork. We use traditional methods and materials, which are carefully and sympathetically balanced with modern techniques and equipment. This allows us to keep the build of each chair as true to the original as possible.</p>
<p>Features such as tenon joints and the smooth, hand shaped frame are characteristics we've been keen to carry forward from some of the most respected and well known sofa and chair makers of the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
<h2>The Frame</h2>
<p>Each frame is made to order by hand. We use sustainable beech as standard, the integral legs can be made from any timber desired - allowing the exposed wood to be matched against existing furniture or personal taste without the need of artificial staining or colouring.</p>
<p>Great time and focus was spent sourcing the correct frame maker for the DeCourcey, ensuring each chair will last a lifetime.</p>

<p>A variation on the original Edwardian design is the subtle lift in the lumber springs to allow the insertion of a feather seat cushion. This minor change enhances both the look of the Desmond sofa as well as increasing the level of comfort.</p>
<p>The second alteration was the removal of the integral arm rests at the frame making stage, opting now for a smooth and elegant curve which continues down into the frame base.</p>
